        Hi everyone, let me introduce myself. I'm from Brazil, from a city called Belém, located in the north of the country, but I currently live in Las Vegas, USA. Two months ago I married the most beautiful woman in the world, her name is Emilia. We were sealed in the Las Vegas Temple.

        I've been a member of the church my whole life, that means 28 years. I was a missionary at the Brasil Santa Maria mission, located in the south of Brazil, my mission borders Argentina and Uruguay.

        I speak 3 languages, Portuguese natively, English and Spanish. I love sports and I love to compete. I practice Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and I also love motorsports like Formula 1 and Formula Drift. I love technology and I'm super excited to learn more about HTML.
